# Warning

For archival purpose only, this code is not maintained anymore.
Please note that this a copy of the code I have used to run the simulations and not a version tailored for public use.
For robust replication, we advise to reimplement the model using the description provided in the corresponding paper.

The code uses personal packages (Utility.jl and Toolbox_network.jl). A version of these packages will be upload in the future. Note that these packages only implement functions to facilitate the coding but the core code necessary to reimplement the model is all present in the code uploaded.

For any questions, please contact cedric.perret.research@gmail.com
